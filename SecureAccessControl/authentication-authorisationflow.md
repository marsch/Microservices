# Authentication/Authorisation handling in Microservice Environment #


## Authorisation ##
---

#### [Oauth2](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/)  
Authentication Service generates Tokens and can also validate them.  


**Pros**:  
* One Service to do all the authorization related work (no shared keys between services or Persistence)

**Cons**:  
* Single Point of failure
* higher Network Traffic load for communication


#### [Oauth2 with JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)  
Authentication Service generates Tokens (example: JWT)  and the validation is done by each service.  

**Pros**:   
* split workload and reduce Network Traffic  

**Cons**: 
* there is a shared Lib and a shared Secret which needs to be maintained.
* A non-backwards compatible change may require restarting all affected services.


## Authentication ##
---
#### [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/)  
Protocoll Suite for Authentication & SSO based on OAuth2.0  

**Pros**:
* Small payload, highly optimised for WEB applications

**Cons**:
* Authorisation is handeled by OAuth2.0 (you need OpenID Connect and OAuth2.0)


## Authorisation & Authentication ##
---

#### [SAMl2.0](http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications)  
XML based Standard for exchange Authentication & Authorisation Data, to archive Single Sign On (SSO), Federation and Identity Management  

**Pros**:
* data transfer is free to use (SOAP, HTTP, JMS ...)
* combine both Authentication and Authorisation

**Cons**:
* XML payload (assertions) very Big

## Usecases and Findings ##
---

### Authentication and Authorisation from enduser  

* that case is not a part from OIH because only APIs are communicating

### Authorisation from APIs

* it is common practice to use OAuth2.0 in combination with JWT

## Challenges

1.  the Type and or component to choose depends on what is more possible to achieve. implementation of needed features or managing a 3rd Party Software.
